# Thoughts On Open Source:
**Capitalism and the Ownership of ideas**

In a capitalist world, everything is a transaction. As people, we are rotating between states of being owners, consumers and products. 

We have seen, with things like social media, that something being free is not enough. It comes at the price of our attention and our data. In that case, we as people become closer to products. We become natural resources to be mined. Because of the way our society is constructed, our only options are owning something to sell or selling our labour to sustain ourselves. 

Obsession with ownership is a feature of our world and it extends beyond physical things, into concepts and ideas.

Who gets to own an idea? Of course it is clearly an injustice that often times it’s not whoever creates it, but is it really possible to create an idea in the first place? 

Really creating something completely by yourself is not possible. Nothing exists in a vacuum. Every idea is necessarily based on other ideas that came before it, which are themselves based on other ideas. Everything is influenced by the environment in which it was produced, by history, by the materials used and no one person can really produce anything alone and uninfluenced. 

In some ways this truth can be upsetting, particularly to artists, because it’s like saying that everything is inherently derivative and unoriginal. I believe, as designers, we need to get rid of this concept of ownership and control over an idea. Historically, and in our day to day lives, we can see that this obsession with property and ownership comes at the price of not only innovation, but it creates a gruesome reality for so many people struggling and being exploited under our capitalist system. 

Technology represented a potential for a different world, and even though it has been co-opted and eroded by the same idea of ownership, that potential exists in open source. A truly open-source world is available to everyone. It is accommodating. It is not only free, but publicly owned. Everything is everything else. Open-source, ideologically, breaks down hierarchies. It is a disruptive force. It is a threat to a world so deeply obsessed with property and domination.
